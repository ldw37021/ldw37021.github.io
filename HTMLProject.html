	<h2>A Quick Bio</h2>
	
	<p>Throughout Freshman year, Luke debated what major to settle on. Initially, he came in as intended general business. Soon, he refined it more to 
	intended Finance, but quickly made a jump into the STEM world with Computer Science. Most of Luke's second semester was in this major until switching 
	into Early Childhood Education over the Summer. He finally settled on a major during the first week of sophomore classes with MIS and a co-major in International Business.</p>
	
	<p>A major moment in Luke's life, both personally and academically, was his freshman summer at <a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en"><em>Webroot</em></a>, a cyber-security firm in Colorado. At Webroot, he saw all sides of the technical 
	world and realized, although he wants to spend time in cyber-security, he does not want to spend 8 hours a day behind a computer. One of the most interesting 
	parts of the company was the Security Analyst, which has the most direct pipeline through MIS. Luke also hopes to one day work his way up to <abbr title="Chief Information Security Officer">CISO</abbr></p>
	
	<p>Although he had settled on majoring in MIS, Luke knew he wanted his life to involve traveling. One of the reasons that made Colorado such an incredible experience was the fact it was in Colorado.
	Spending 8 weeks on the other side of the country allowed him to see there was a lot more to the world than Georgia.
	He hopes that International Business will allow him to spend time in places he has never been too, while showing him 
	cultures around the world.</p>
