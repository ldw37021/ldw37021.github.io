	<h2>A Quick Bio</h2>
	<p>Luke Wilbanks graduated from Hebron Christian Academy in 2017 with a 3.94 GPA. While there, he dedicated his after school time to golf, track, 
	cross country, or writing, depending on the season. Up until the end of senior year, he was trying to decide whether to go UGA, Wake Forest, or 
	Samford. Ultimely, Luke chose UGA due to the Zell and Hope Scholarships.</p>
	<p>Throughout Freshman year, Luke debated what major to settle. Initially, he came in as intended general business. Soon, he refined it more to 
	intended Finance, but quickly made a jump into the STEM world with computer science. Most of Luke's second semester was in this major until switching 
	into Early Childhood Education over the Summer. He finally settled on a major during add and drop week with MIS and a comajor in International Business.</p>
	<p>One of Luke's final major change was spending his freshman summer at Webroot, a cyber-security firm in Colorado. At Webroot, he saw all sides of the technical 
	world and realized although he wants to spend time in cyber-security, he does not want to spend 8 hours a day behind a computer. One of the most interesting 
	parts of the company was the Security Analyst, which has the most direct pipeline through MIS.
